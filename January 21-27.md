**I'm currently reading Steinbeck's *East of Eden* for the first time for personal pleasure. I enjoy Steinbeck's conversational storytelling and I'll use this space to document some of the sentences I find most striking. **

- "...[they] were mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want tot climb into the lap of a beloved mother."

- "And that energy which had made him wild now made him thoughtful."

- "When a child first catches adults out - when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their sentences just - his world falls into panic desolation." 

- "So many things are done instinctively, the way a bee makes honey or a fox dips his paws in a stream to fool dogs. A fox can't say why he does it, and what bee remembers winter or expects it to come again?" 

- "He was born in fury and lived in lightning."

- "Summer was cool in the mountains, and the mountain people were kind as lonesome people are kind."
